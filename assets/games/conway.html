			Conway's game of life is a very simple cellular automatat game, based around the following rules:<br><br>
			1. Any live cell with less than two live neighbours dies <br>	
			2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives<br>
			3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies<br>
			4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell<br><br>
			technically conway's game is a zero player game, but in this version you can interact with the global board with updates happening every 5 seconds.
