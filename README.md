# Adam's Homelab

Hello there! This is the repository for my website, https://oasis-homelab.com/ which at current time of writing is being hosted directly out of my closet


I'm hoping for this to be a long term project of mine with many different sub-projects cobbled together under this one domain



#### tech stack

The stack is I'm running Go for the server side locally on my closet laptop which serves the webpages, and Cloudflare Tunnels is routing the traffic to my computer functioning as a reverse proxy

what's cool about this setup is that I'm only paying for the domain, everything else was already on hand or provided for free
